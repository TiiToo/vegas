         * Creates a new FillGradientStyle instance.
         * @param type A value from the GradientType class that specifies which gradient type to use : GradientType.LINEAR or GradientType.RADIAL.
         * @param colors An array of RGB hexadecimal color values to be used in the gradient; for example, red is 0xFF0000, blue is 0x0000FF, and so on. You can specify up to 15 colors. For each color, be sure you specify a corresponding value in the alphas and ratios parameters.
         * @param alphas An array of alpha values for the corresponding colors in the colors array; valid values are 0 to 1. If the value is less than 0, the default is 0. If the value is greater than 1, the default is 1.
         * @param ratios An array of color distribution ratios; valid values are 0 to 255. This value defines the percentage of the width where the color is sampled at 100%. The value 0 represents the left-hand position in the gradient box, and 255 represents the right-hand position in the gradient box.
         * @param matrix A transformation matrix as defined by the flash.geom.Matrix class. The flash.geom.Matrix class includes a createGradientBox() method, which lets you conveniently set up the matrix for use with the beginGradientFill() method.
         * @param spreadMethod A value from the SpreadMethod class that specifies which spread method to use, either: SpreadMethod.PAD, SpreadMethod.REFLECT, or SpreadMethod.REPEAT.
         * @param interpolationMethod A value from the InterpolationMethod class that specifies which value to use: InterpolationMethod.linearRGB or InterpolationMethod.RGB.
         * @param focalPointRatio A number that controls the location of the focal point of the gradient. 0 means that the focal point is in the center. 1 means that the focal point is at one border of the gradient circle. -1 means that the focal point is at the other border of the gradient circle. A value less than -1 or greater than 1 is rounded to -1 or 1.
