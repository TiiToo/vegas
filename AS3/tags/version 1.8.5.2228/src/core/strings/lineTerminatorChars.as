     * Like white space characters, line terminator characters are used to improve source text readability and to separate tokens (indivisible lexical units) from each other. 
     * However, unlike white space characters, line terminators have some influence over the behaviour of the syntactic grammar. 
     * In general, line terminators may occur between any two tokens, but there are a few places where they are forbidden by the syntactic grammar. 
     * A line terminator cannot occur within any token, not even a string. 
     * Line terminators also affect the process of automatic semicolon insertion.
