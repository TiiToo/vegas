     * This class extends the flash.utils.Timer class and implement the graphics.transitions.ITimer class.
     * The Timer class is the interface to Flash Player timers. 
     * You can create new Timer objects to run code on a specified time sequence. 
     * Use the start() method to start a timer. 
     * Add an event listener for the timer event to set up code to be run on the timer interval.
