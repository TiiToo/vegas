     * Circular Lerp is like lerp but handles the wraparound from 0 to 360. 
     * This is useful when interpolating eulerAngles and the object crosses the 0/360 boundary. 
     * The standard Lerp function causes the object to rotate in the wrong direction and looks stupid, clerp() fixes that.
     * <p><b>Example :</b></p>
     * <pre class="prettyprint">
     * import core.maths.clerp ;
     * trace( clerp( 0 , 180 , 0.5 ) ; // 90
     * </pre>
     * @param amount The amount to interpolate between the two values where 0.0 equal to the first point, 0.1 is very near the first point, 0.5 is half-way in between, etc. 
     * @param start the begining value.
     * @param end The ending value.
     * @return The interpolated value between two numbers at a specific increment.
