# Abstract Data Type and Collections with VEGAS #

The collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, allowing them to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. It reduces programming effort while increasing performance.

The **VEGAS** collection framework is inspired on the [JAVA Collections Framework](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/collections/) and the [Jakarta Collections Framework](http://commons.apache.org/collections/).

This framework is inspired on interfaces to defines the differents types of collections.
