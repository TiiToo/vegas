/**
 * The IEventDispatcher interface defines methods for adding or removing event listeners, checks whether specific types of event listeners are registered, and dispatches events. 
 * In general, the easiest way for a user-defined class to gain event dispatching capabilities is to extend EventDispatcher. If this is impossible (that is, if the class is already extending another class), you can instead implement the IEventDispatcher interface, create an EventDispatcher member, and write simple hooks to route calls into the aggregated EventDispatcher.
