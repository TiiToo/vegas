/* Interface: ICloneable
   Allows an object to be copied by reference.
   
   note:
   In general we consider all clone method to
   return a shallow copy (reference) of the current objet.
   
   But in certain particular case a clone can provide a mixed copy
   of the object where some of its members will be copied by reference (objects)
   and others will be copied by value (primitives).
   
   see: <Object.memberwiseClone> and <Array.clone>
   
   example:
   Here a simple way to implement it
   
   (code)
   myCustomObject = function( x, y )
       {
       this.x = x;
       this.y = y;
       }
   
   myCustomObject.prototype.clone = function()
       {
       return this;
       }
   (end)
*/
_global.ICloneable = function()
    {
    
    }

/* Method: clone
   Returns a copy by reference of this object.
   
   attention:
   If the instance is a primitive the behaviour
   is to return a copy by value.
*/
ICloneable.prototype.clone = function()
    {
    
    }
