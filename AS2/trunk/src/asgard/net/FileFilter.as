/**
 * The FileFilter class is used to indicate what files on the user's system are shown in the file-browsing dialog box that 
 * is displayed when {@code FileReference.browse()} or {@code FileReferenceList.browse()} is called. 
 * FileFilter instances are passed to a browse() function. 
 * If you use a FileFilter instance, extensions and file types that aren't specified in the FileFilter instance are filtered out; that is, they are not available to the user to select for uploading. If no FileFilter object is passed to browse(), all files are shown in the dialog box.
 * 
 * <p>You can use FileFilter instances in one of two ways :
 * <ul>
 * <li>A description with Windows file extensions only</li>
 * <li>A description with Windows file extensions and Macintosh file types</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>The two formats are not interchangeable within a single browse() call. You must use one or the other.</p>
 * <p>You can pass one or more FileFilter instances to {@code FileReference.browse()} or {@code FileReferenceList.browse()}. 
 * The following examples show different ways to create and pass {@code FileFilter} instances to a {@code browse()} call (for Windows only). 
 * The first example creates FileFilter instances outside of the browse() call:</p>
 * {@code
 * var imagesFilter:FileFilter = new FileFilter("Images", "*.jpg;*.gif;*.png") ;
 * var docFilter:FileFilter    = new FileFilter("Documents", "*.pdf;*.doc;*.txt") ;
 * var myFileReference:FileReference = new FileReference() ;
 * myFileReference.browse([imagesFilter, docFilter]) ;
 * }
 * <p>The second example creates FileFilter instances within the browse() call:</p>
 * {@code
 * myFileReference.browse( [ new FileFilter("Images", "*.jpg;*.gif;*.png"), new FileFilter("Flash Movies", "*.swf") ] );
 * }
 * The list of extensions in the FileFilter.extension property is used to filter the files in Windows, 
 * depending on the file selected by the user. 
 * It is not actually displayed in the dialog box; to display the file types for users, you must list the file 
 * types in the description string as well as in the extension list. 
 * The description string is displayed in the dialog box in Windows. 
 * (It is not used on the Macintosh.) On the Macintosh, if you supply a list of Macintosh file types, that list is used to filter the files. 
 * If not, the list of Windows extensions is used.
