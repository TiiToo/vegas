	 * <p>A matrix object (supported by Flash Player 8 and later only), as defined by the flash.geom.Matrix class. The flash.geom.Matrix class includes a createGradientBox() method, which lets you conveniently set up the matrix for use with the beginGradientFill() method of MovieClip class. Macromedia recommends that you use this form of matrix for Flash Player 8 and later.</p>

If a value of less than 0 is passed, Flash Player uses 0. The value 0 indicates hairline thickness; the maximum thickness is 255. If a value greater than 255 is passed, the Flash interpreter uses 255.
	 * @param color A hexadecimal color value of the line; for example, red is 0xFF0000, blue is 0x0000FF, and so on. If a value isn't indicated, Flash uses 0x000000 (black).
	 * @param alpha An integer that indicates the alpha value of the line's color; valid values are 0 to 100. If a value isn't indicated, Flash uses 100 (solid). If the value is less than 0, Flash uses 0; if the value is greater than 100, Flash uses 100.
	 * @param pixelHinting Added in Flash Player 8. A Boolean value that specifies whether to hint strokes to full pixels. This value affects both the position of anchors of a curve and the line stroke size itself. If a value is not indicated, Flash Player does not use pixel hinting.
	 * @param noScale Added in Flash Player 8. A string that specifies how to scale a stroke. Valid values are as follows:
	 * <p>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>"normal" - Always scale the thickness (the default).</li>
	 * <li>"none" - Never scale the thickness.</li>
	 * <li>"vertical" - Do not scale thickness if object is scaled vertically only.</li>

	 * @param miterLimit Added in Flash Player 8. A number that indicates the limit at which a miter is cut off. Valid values range from 1 to 255 (and values outside of that range are rounded to 1 or 255). This value is only used if the jointStyle is set to "miter". If a value is not indicated, Flash uses 3. The miterLimit value represents the length that a miter can extend beyond the point at which the lines meet to form a joint. The value expresses a factor of the line thickness. For example, with a miterLimit factor of 2.5 and a thickness of 10 pixels, the miter is cut off at 25 pixels.
